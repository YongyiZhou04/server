We can have many designs for how orders are filled. Now there are a few assumptions that we must make:
1. Do we have sellers and buyers
2. Is it FIFO, Proata, Top, or LMM?
3. Can orders expire and, if so, what is the expiration time (time-in-force).

Of course, we can implement many schemes and this is something you can do. But, let's just focus on one thing right now...

For simplicity and as a warmup, let's assume that there is always a buyer and always a seller. In this case, we just need
to satisfy requests and send back the successful action (sell or buy) at the market price that the order was placed. Of course,
this is overly simplistic, but this is just a warmup after all.

Now, for the second model, let's go for something more realistic and complex. Let's do a FIFO structure that matches the first
buy order to a sell order such that buy > sell. Now, one might consider what the price should be. The price doesn't matter, as long
as the buyer is offering a price higher than the seller is willing to sell for. In a real market, you can imagine that buyers and sellers
will converge in their prices since buyers don't want to pay for more than they have to and seller don't want to sell for less than they
desire. Thus, there will always ne some haggling but the prices of sell and buys should all be in close proximity.

This is good for now, we can deal with the other schemes later.
